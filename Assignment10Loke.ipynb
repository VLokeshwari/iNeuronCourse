    "### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "While shutil. copy() will copy a single file, shutil. copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What function is used to rename files?\n",
    "\n",
    "os. rename() method in Python is used to rename a file or directory. This method renames a source file/ directory to specified destination file/directory. For that we have import os package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "The os and shutil modules offer functions for copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files. When deleting files, you might want to use the send2trash module to move files to the recycle bin or trash rather than permanently deleting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ZipFile method which is equivalent to File objects' open() method is zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip')\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder."
