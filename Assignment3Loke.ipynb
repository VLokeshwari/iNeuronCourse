    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. A \n",
    "\n",
    "Function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function’s \n",
    "\n",
    "return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The Code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The “def” keyword is a statement for defining a function in python. You will start a function using “def” keyword, \n",
    "\n",
    "specify a name followed by a colon(:) sign. The “def” call creates the function object and assigns it to the name given. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can further re-assign the same function object to other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A FUCNTION is a block of code that does a particular operation and returns a result. It usually accepts inputs as \n",
    "\n",
    "parameters and returns a result. The parameters are not mandatory. A FUNCTION CALL  is the code used to pass control to \n",
    "\n",
    "FUCNTION.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program \n",
    "\n",
    "terminates and all its name are forgotten. Otherwise, the name time you were to run the program, the names would remember \n",
    "\n",
    "their values from the pervious run.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: By default, the assignment statement creates variables  in the local scope. So the assignment inside the function \n",
    "\n",
    "does not modify the global variable a, it creates a new local variable called a, and assigns the value 3 to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result to the caller. The \n",
    "\n",
    "statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the \n",
    "\n",
    "special value None is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function \n",
    "\n",
    "after the las statement of the called function is executed. In this case, the return value of the called function is \n",
    "\n",
    "undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables \n",
    "\n",
    "are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all. None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty \n",
    "\n",
    "string. None is a data type of its own (None Type) and only None can be None.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. This function can be called with spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \tusing dot notation\n",
    "\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Instead, error handling can be used to notify the user of why the error occurred and gracefully exit the process \n",
    "\n",
    "that caused the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A try clause is executed up until the point where the first exception is encountered. Inside the except clause, or \n",
    "\n",
    "the exception handler, you determine how the program responds to the exception. You can anticipate multiple exceptions and \n",
    "\n",
    "differentiate how the program should respond to them.\n"
