    "\n",
    "Answer: The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.\n",

    "10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The only difference between append() and insert()  is the insert() function allows us to add a specific element at \n",
    "\n",
    "a specified index of the list unlike append() where we can add the element only at end of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 1. Using the remove() method.\n",

    "        2. Using the list object’s pop() method.\n",

    "     \n",
    "12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The most important differences between list and tuple is that list is mutable, whereas a tuple is immutable. This\n",
    "\n",
    "means that lists can be changed, and tuples cannot be changed. But tuples are immutable, they cannot be copied.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: (42,) the trailing comma is mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Python list of tuples using list comprehension and tuple() method. Python tuple() method along with List \n",
    "\n",
    "comprehension can be used to form a list of tuples. The tuple() function helps to create tuples from the set of elements \n",
    "\n",
    "passed to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Deepcopy() copies original \n",
    "\n",
    "object recursively, while . copy() create a reference object to first-level data of original object. So the \n",
